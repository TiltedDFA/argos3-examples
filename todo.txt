draw box plot of number of robots in an area at the end of a simulation

could eval num connections

maybe stop robots when they reach target zone - 

https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html

sperate data files into folders

would need to experiment to find best time period

could measure time taken for x% of robots to reach a target area

potentially add another alg either flocking/aggregation

could change how to code work to try to reach a robot with hc0 instead of searching for target zones

look into simulation communication faults and adding them to the automation scripts

alpha alg for aggregation

excel sheet on possible errors. change the xml for errors that can be simulated in the xml. Make new branches on git for errors that would require code changes. Pick 2-3. Make sure to keep possible errors even if not implmanted.

start poster on 10th week.

save graphs as .svg or .pdf

make poster eye catching

measure avg distance between all robots

boxplot /line graphs would both be good
